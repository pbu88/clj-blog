    Hey there,
    </p>

    <p>
    My name is Paulo and I'm a software developer. I enjoy all kinds of programming
    and I'm always trying to learn new stuff... like this page is the result of me
    learning Clojure. You may find the source code for this page on <a href="https://github.com/pbu88/clj-blog">Github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Profesionally I've been working mainly with Python as a web developer. On my
    spare time I also use to answer some questions at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1401900/paulo-bu">StackOverflow</a> and train my
    algorithms skills in several online judges like <a href="https://open.kattis.com/users/pbu">Kattis</a> or 
    <a href="https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=20&page=show_authorstats&userid=511358">UVa</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    I live in Amsterdam and currently I'm trying to learn Dutch! I have a weird
    passion for languages and Dutch has been quite a nice challenge :)
